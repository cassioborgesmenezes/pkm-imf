Check out the four different ways the same (19) concepts have been organized. Just like the primordial goop that collided together billions of years ago to spark life on earth, so do these conceptual collisions spark exciting and diverse ideas.


- Example 1 - Mapped for daily reminders
- Example 2 - Mapped by categories
- Example 3 - Mapped by different categories
- Example 4 - Mapped A-Z

## Concepts MOC - Daily Reminders
Why not string out these ideas into paragraphs? What a way to unearth hidden connections...

*A concept is a pattern, truth, or mechanism recognized and given a name.*

Starting some days, I'll consider how to apply three *strategic* mental models: [[OODA Loop]], [[Levels of Magnification]], and [[Contextual Lenses]].

For my work as an editor/AE in TV, I know to improve my craft means the steady application of getting [[Reps]], creating the conditions for [[Flow]], which involves environmental  [[Forcing Function|Forcing Functions]], and considering when I can multitask [[Shadow Clone]]. 


[[Natural Selection]] is one of the mega-concepts. It helps me decipher the signal from the noise through the mechanism of considering the [[Lindy Effect]], along with [[Hormesis]] and [[Antifragility]]—and also more broadly [[Cause and Effect]].

In times of stress it helps me to broaden my perspective and consider concepts like: [[Ying and Yang]], [[Synthesis]], [[Seasons]].

Dealing with folks in the entertainment industry—and just throughout life really—there are plenty of instances to consider ways to handle ego and aggression. The most fascinating is [[No-Face]] from Spirited Away, which leads to [[The Id]]. [[Aikido]] is good to remember.

For more avenues to re-expanded my narrowed perspectve, try to revisit the [[Rubik's Cube]], or pull from [[Charlie Munger's Mental Models]].
